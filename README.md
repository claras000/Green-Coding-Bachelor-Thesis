# GREEN CODING â€“ Analysis of Resource, Energy, and Time Consumption of Modern JavaScript Frontend Frameworks

Bachelor Thesis | University of Bremen | 2025

Experimental setup to measure the resource, energy, and time consumption of frontend applications. The Experiment uses three examples: ReactJS, Vue, and VanillaJS.  
The benchmark tests aim to evaluate the ecological sustainability of using JavaScript frameworks. 

## About the Experiment

This experiment is part of the bachelor thesis "GREEN CODING" and measures the ecological sustainability of three identical, synthetic web applications. For this the Setup uses serveral Dockers to Isolate the components Frontend, Backend and Network for each test.
The applications is a Setup for a measurement by the Green Metrics Tool from Green Coding Berlin.

## Measurement

To conduct the measurements, follow the instructions provided by Green Coding Berlin:
