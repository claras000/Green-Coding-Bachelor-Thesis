# GREEN CODING â€“ Analysis of Resource, Energy, and Time Consumption of Modern JavaScript Frontend Frameworks

Bachelor Thesis | University of Bremen | 2025

Experimental setup to measure the resource, energy, and time consumption of frontend applications built with ReactJS, Vue, and VanillaJS.  
The benchmark tests aim to evaluate the ecological sustainability of using JavaScript frameworks.

## About the Experiment

This experiment is part of the bachelor thesis "GREEN CODING" and measures the ecological sustainability of three identical synthetic web applications inside Docker environments.  
The applications are structured to be directly measurable using the Green Metrics Tool by Green Coding Berlin.

## Measurement

To conduct the measurements, follow the instructions provided by Green Coding Berlin:
